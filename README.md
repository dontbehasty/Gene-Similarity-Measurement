# Gene-Similarity-Measurement
Web based system that measures the similarity between genes. 

The system uses a database which is available from the Gene Ontology consortium website.
This database contains annotations of genes and gene products to terms in the Gene Ontology.
The system is also based on a similarity method that was created by Anurag Nagar and Hisham Al-Mubaid. 
This method measures similarity by calculating the path length (distance) between the two gene products or GO terms.
