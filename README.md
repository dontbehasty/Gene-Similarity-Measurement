# Gene-Similarity-Measurement
Web based system that measures the similarity between genes. 

The system uses a database which is available from the Gene Ontology consortium website.
This database contains annotations of genes and gene products to terms in the Gene Ontology.
The system is also based on a similarity method that was created by Anurag Nagar and Hisham Al-Mubaid. 
This method measures similarity by calculating the path length (distance) between the two gene products or GO terms.

For this project there is going to be two separate similarity methods.
The first method will measure the similarity between gene ontology terms and the second method will measure the similarity between gene products.

<b><u>Similarity by Path Length (distance)</b></u><br>
After researching the different ways of measuring the similarity betweens genes, it has been decided that path length between GO terms will be used to calculate the similarity for the purposed system. The method was designed by Anurag Nagar and Hisham Al-Mubaid. The smaller the path length (distance) is, then the more similar the two genes are.
